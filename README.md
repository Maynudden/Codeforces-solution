# Codeforces-solution
This repository contains C++ solutions for several problems typically encountered in competitive programming contests. Each solution is optimized for performance and uses standard input/output methods.
A_Forked.cpp
Determines the number of common attack positions between a "king-like" and "queen-like" piece given chessboard movements with custom step sizes. Uses sets for intersection checking.

B_Lady_Bug.cpp
Compares two binary strings based on alternating bit position rules. Checks conditions on characters at even and odd indices and outputs YES or NO accordingly.

B_St_Chroma.cpp
Constructs a permutation of numbers based on two integers n and x. If x == n, it prints numbers 0 to n-1. Otherwise, it prints all numbers from 0 to n-1 skipping x and prints x at the end.

C_Neo's_Escape.cpp
Counts the number of "peaks" in an array. A peak is a contiguous segment of equal numbers that is strictly greater than its neighbors.


 Features
Fast input/output for competitive environments

Zero dependencies (only uses standard headers)

Clean and modular functions for ease of debugging and reuse
